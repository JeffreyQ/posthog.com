## Mission

To create the easiest experience to discover insights about products and its end users.

## Responsibilities
List below is prioritized.

1. Reaching parity in terms of features, performance and user experience with leading product analytics solutions, including:
   1. Maintaining data quality and consistency.
   2. Ensuring performant and clear user experience across all analytics functionality.
   3. Extending core feature set as informed by dogfooding, user feedback, experimentation and strategic decisions.
   4. Extending user experience to enable product analytics for non-technical users. 
2. Maintaining (and improving where applicable) supporting activities for the core experience (this includes: cohorts, persons, sessions *[not session recording]*, annotations, settings, authentication, account management). 


## Customer

Any PostHog user, whether they're an engineer, product manager or business person, should be able to effectively analyze their product.

## Output metrics
Our output metrics can be tracked in [Dashboard #3307](https://app.posthog.com/dashboard/3307).

#### WAU/MAU ratio
Ratio of weekly active users versus monthly active users (rolling period) where an active user is someone who *Discovered a Learning* during the period. This signals core product usage without being affected by activation or acquisition activities.
- Measurements for the purpose of an output metric will be done weekly.
- More context on the metric can be found in [the relevant issue](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/issues/1).


#### Parity progress
Details coming soon.
