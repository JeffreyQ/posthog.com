## Mission

To create the easiest way to discover insights about products and its users

## Responsibilities

- Extending feature set as suggested by requests, by our own ideas, and by need for parity with other platforms
- Maintaining data quality and clarity
- Ensuring performant and clear user experience across all analytics functionality


## Customer

- Any PostHog user, whether they're an engineer or a product manager, should be able to effectively analyze their product.

## Output metrics
Our output metrics can be tracked in [Dashboard #3307](https://app.posthog.com/dashboard/3307).

#### WAU/MAU ratio
Ratio of weekly active users versus monthly active users (rolling period) where an active user is someone who *Discovered a Learning* during the period. This signals core product usage without being affected by activation or acquisition activities.
- Measurements for the purpose of an output metric will be done weekly.
- More context on the metric can be found in [the relevant issue](https://github.com/PostHog/internal/issues/263).
